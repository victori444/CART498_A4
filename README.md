# Implementation

Jungian ideas are implemented in this dream analysis machine through detailed prompt design. The textual interpretation is generated first and then used as input for image generation. The prompt defines the model’s role (via the developer role) as an assistant trained in Jung’s analytical psychology and explicitly instructs that interpretations should be symbolic rather than literal. The user’s dream description is then included, and the model is directed to focus on four main elements:

1. **Key symbols & figures**  
2. **Jungian archetypes (if applicable)**  
3. **Emotional tone**  
4. **The unconscious**

These four elements were defined based on key concepts from Jungian psychology identified through online research. The model is configured with a medium-to-high temperature to encourage imaginative and creative responses, while avoiding outputs that become absurd or illegible. The interpretation generated by the first model then becomes part of the input for the image generation model. Because the interpretation is more visual and symbolic — rather than a literal description of the dream — the resulting illustrations are more abstract and aligned with Jungian aesthetics.

# Reflection

In my process of building this web application, I had to tweak many parts of my prompting to receive results that were satisfactory and legible by the user. Firstly, I observed that in prompting for a Jungian analysis of dreams, the text result was very wordy and unstructured. To alleviate both the jargon and visual block of text, I provided a structure to the model in my prompt such that information would be organized and focused based on four key concepts: key symbols & figures, Jungian archetypes, emotional tone, and the unconscious. The result received was in markdown due to the imposed structure, which required more formatting on the frontend. I also observed that the generated image was consistently in a specific art style, composed of painterly brushstrokes and theatrical lighting. The addition of image generation to the application significantly increased load time in comparison to solely generating text. To address this, I would improve the user experience by adding a loadbar to indicate that the input was received and is being processed. I also think it would be interesting if the page & the model kept a memory of a user’s dreams and their interpretations, such that patterns could be identified over time.
